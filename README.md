# Box Pane Frame

A boxy frame with (probably clear) plastic pane in the middle. Designed to be laser cut.

If desired, the pane could be made from 2 pieces of material, allowing something to be sandwiched in between. The `panelThickness` variable may need to be changed when doing this.

I think I'll use these materials:

* Box: 6 mm [Macrocarpa Hardwood](https://www.ponoko.com/materials/macrocarpa-hardwood)
* Pane: 2 sheets of 1.5 mm [Clear PETG](https://www.ponoko.com/materials/clear-petg)
