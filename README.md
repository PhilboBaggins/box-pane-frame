# Box Pane Frame

A boxy frame with (probably clear) plastic pane in the middle. Designed to be laser cut. I think I'll use these materials:

* Box: [Macrocarpa Hardwood](https://www.ponoko.com/materials/macrocarpa-hardwood)
* Pane: [Clear PETG](https://www.ponoko.com/materials/clear-petg)

If desired, the pane could be made from 2 pieces of material, allowing something to be sandwiched in between. The `panelThickness` variable may need to be changed when doing this.
